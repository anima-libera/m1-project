## What has been done

### Paper draft submitted!

Well now its done ^^.

## What to do next

### Regenerate images

1000 pins makes the Moire patterns disappear! Regenerate all the iamges of the paper before the new deadline!

### Error on muliple levels of detail

Use multiple resolutions at the same time, with some multiplicative distribution of their importance or something.

### Fast eraising of lines

On the back-and-white HD resolution, instead of storring the boolean inforlmation of wether a line is overlapping a pixel or not, save instead the number of lines overlapping it. With a deterministic line drawing algorithm and no floating point error stuff it should do it.
