## What has been done

### Refactoring is on the way

String art abilities are almost like the ones of the previous implementation, on much more solid foundations for the code to be actually maintainable.

## What to do next

### Read papers!!!

It will be necessary for the *Related Works* section! It must be allocated some time (that will be taken from programming).

### End refactoring

End refactoring, implementing all the ideas that were previously discussed in a readable way.

### New ideas (the stream never ends)

- Make the memory state of the string art algoritm serializable, allowing for stopping and *resuming* an execution.
- Automate parameter space exploration, starting by bruteforcing an entire parameter space looking for the best outcomes.
- Allow for dynamic updates of string art algorithm parameters, making it able to change its heuristics when it seems like some new ones would do a better job.
