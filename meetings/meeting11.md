## What to do next

### Start a paper for a conference

The [Bridges](https://www.bridgesmathart.org/b2022/) conference seems highly appropriate to target for a reaserch paper on this project to target. An almost finished paper must be submitted before the deadline of the 1st of February. An [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) colaborative LaTeX document is to be started very soon.

### Produce tangible results for the paper

The paper is now of the highest priority among the tasks that must be completed for this research project, thus the quality of the code is secondary now. Raw data and results must be produced and condensed into useful and relevant interpretations. Some previous TODO lists already contain some entries that should be considered to get the intresting results quick, such as:

- Bruteforcing a set of combinaisons of heuristics/resolutions/preprocessing/colors to compare the many results.
- See what can be optimized in terms of speed (such as paralelizable parts of the code) and memory usage.
- Compute the asymptotic time and space complexities, these might depend of some parameters (some of which may be exclusive to some heuristics).
